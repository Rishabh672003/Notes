Programming notes written by [Rishabh672003](https://github.com/Rishabh672003) and [amitsuthar69](https://github.com/amitsuthar69)

What we are now working on basic Computer Science concepts like different Data Structures, Algorithms and Object oriented programming in C++.

If you want to contribute to the repository don't be afraid to open a PR
if its good, We will most definitely merge it. Thanks for your time.

## Development

This has been made with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook),
so to get started do the following step -

1. All markdown files need to be added to `src` folder then Append/Edit the `src/SUMMARY.md` to add pages and change the structure of the book website.

2. Start the mdbook server to see the changes with `mdbook serve --open`

3. Then to publish the book just do `mdbook build`

4. Push the changes and the Github action will automatically publish the website

Now at least all the CPP notes are hosted on this website - https://rishabh672003.github.io/Programming-Notes/
So you can add more notes and make pull request to this branch
