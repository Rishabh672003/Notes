## Working of the CPU

A CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is the brain of a computer. It processes
instructions and data, and carries out the basic operations of a computer.
The CPU is made up of two main components: the control unit (CU) and the
arithmetic logic unit (ALU).

The control unit fetches instructions from memory and decodes them,
determining what operation needs to be performed. It then
sends the necessary information to the ALU to carry out the operation. The ALU
performs mathematical and logical operations on data, such as addition,
subtraction, and comparison. The CPU also has registers, which are small, fast
storage locations that hold data and instructions that the CPU uses frequently.
This allows the CPU to quickly access the data it needs without having to retrieve
it from memory each time. The CPU also has a clock that controls the timing
of the operations it performs.

The clock sends out a regular pulse, called a clock cycle, which the CPU uses
to synchronize its operations. The speed of the CPU, measured in hertz (Hz),
is determined by the number of clock cycles it can perform per second.
The CPU also communicates with other components in a computer, such as memory
and input/output (I/O) devices, through a set of connections called buses.
These buses allow the CPU to send and receive data and instructions to and
from other parts of the computer.

In summary, the CPU is the heart of the computer that performs the operations
and calculations, and control the flow of data. It fetches instruction
from memory, decodes them, performs the operation with the help of ALU and
communicates with other parts of computer through buses.
