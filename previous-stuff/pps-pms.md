Password generators. Most password managers will allow you to generate a safe password with varying complexity. Not only this saves your time, but it also comes up with better passwords.
It makes the process easier. Password managers are not only one of the safest ways to store passwords. A reliable password manager tool will allow you to administrate all your logins from one application.
No more typing. Most password managers have a built-in feature that allows you to auto-fill passwords and other recurring information. It extends to your payment information or addresses. It saves you the hassle of needing to remember every single one of your passwords
Cross-platform support. As applications, password managers are not at all complicated and do not require a lot of resources. It means that it’s much easier to develop them for a variety of platforms like web browsers or smartphone apps. For the end-user, this means an ability to get the same password vault no matter what’s your preferred method of connection.
Multi-factor authentication. Even if a hacker would install a keylogger and get your master password, this wouldn’t mean the end of the world if you have two-factor authentication enabled. The password would be useless without it, so you would still be safe, and the vault would stay locked.
