# Classes and objects

In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and methods (functions) that operate on that data. Classes are used to define objects, which are instances of the class.

For example, if we are creating a banking program, we can give our class the following characteristics:
name: BankAccount
attributes: accountNumber, balance, dateOpened
behavior: open(), close(), deposit()

The class specifies that each object should have the defined attributes and behavior. However, it doesn't specify what the actual data is; it only provides a definition.

Once we've written the class, we can move on to create objects that are based on that class.
Each object is called an instance of a class. The process of creating objects is called instantiation.
