# Object Oriented Programming

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that
organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate
data and behavior. In OOP, objects are the building blocks of programs, and they
interact through methods, messages, and inheritance.

## Why should you use OOP?

There are several reasons why we use OOP:

1. Modularity and Reusability: OOP promotes modularity by encapsulating related
   data and behavior into objects. This allows for code reuse, as objects can be
   easily instantiated and used in different parts of a program or in different
   programs altogether.

2. Abstraction and Encapsulation: OOP allows us to abstract complex systems by
   breaking them down into smaller, more manageable objects. Encapsulation ensures
   that the internal details of an object are hidden, and only the necessary
   information is exposed through methods and properties. This improves code
   maintainability, security, and reduces complexity.

3. Code Organization and Structure: OOP provides a structured approach to
   organizing code. Objects and classes provide a natural way to represent real
   -world entities and relationships, making the code more intuitive and easier to
   understand and maintain.

## How does OOP differ from other paradigms?

OOP differs from other programming paradigms, such as procedural programming or functional programming, in several ways:

1. Procedural programming focuses on writing procedures or functions that
   operate on data. It is more linear and follows a step-by-step approach. In
   contrast, OOP focuses on objects and their interactions, providing a more
   modular and organized approach to programming.

2. Functional programming emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable
   data. It avoids changing state and focuses on transformations of data. OOP, on
   the other hand, allows for mutable state and focuses on encapsulating data and
   behavior within objects.

3. OOP provides concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation,
   which are not typically found in procedural or functional programming. These
   concepts enable code reuse, abstraction, and more flexible design patterns.

In summary, OOP is a programming paradigm that promotes code organization,
reusability, and abstraction through the use of objects, classes, inheritance,
and encapsulation. It provides a structured and intuitive approach to building
complex systems and differs from other paradigms in its focus on objects and
their interactions.
