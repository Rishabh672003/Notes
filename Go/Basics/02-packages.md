## Packages

Every Go program is mode up of packages!

You have probably noticed the `package main` at the top of the programs we've seen yet. A package named `main` has an entrypoint at the `main()` function. **A main package is compiled into an executable program.**

A package by any other name is a `library package`. Such libraries have no entry point. Libraries simply export functionality that can be used by other packages.

A collection of these packages that are released together are called **Go module(s)**

---

When you need your code to do something that might have been implemented by someone else, you can look for a package that has functions you can use in your code.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"rsc.io/quote" // importing an external package
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println(quote.Go()) // callling the Go function
}
```

---

### Add new module requirements and sums.

Go will add the quote module as a requirement in `go.mod` file, as well as a `go.sum` file for use in **authenticating the module**.

```
$ go mod tidy
```

Run your code to see the message generated by the function you're calling.

```
$ go run .
```

Notice that your code calls the Go function, printing a clever message about communication.

When you ran `go mod tidy`, it located and downloaded the `rsc.io/quote` module that contains the package you imported.

By default, it downloaded the latest version `-- v1.5.2`.

---

`go.mod` file updates to :

```mod
module example/hello

go 1.21.5

require rsc.io/quote v1.5.2

require (
	golang.org/x/text v0.0.0-20170915032832-14c0d48ead0c // indirect
	rsc.io/sampler v1.3.0 // indirect
)
```

the new `go.sum` file :

```sum
golang.org/x/text v0.0.0-20170915032832-14c0d48ead0c h1:qgOY6WgZOaTkIIMiVjBQcw93ERBE4m30iBm00nkL0i8=
